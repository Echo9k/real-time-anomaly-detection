## About the dataset

The dataset utilized in our project represents a sample extracted from a real-life dataset focused on a social networking context. It specifically analyzes user interactions concerning the expenditure of in-app currency over a defined period. This dataset includes two key features: the normalized average amount of in-app currency spent by users (denoted as 'mean'), and the standard deviation of these expenditures (referred to as 'sd'). Upon analysis of the dataset, it is observed that a majority of the data points cluster within a specific range, while some values significantly deviate from this central tendency. These deviations often represent outliers or anomalies, indicative of users whose spending patterns are notably different from the general user base.
